												<h4>Water Status</h4>

												<p>The projected present water demand for Kitui County is 186,000m³/day. The current production is about 42,000m³/day. The available supply can therefore meet only about 25% of demand consequently the available water in Mombasa is distributed on a rationing basis according to existing rationing program.</p>


												<h4>water quality</h4>
												<p>Mombasa water ensures daily quality monitoring before the water is distributed to the customers. Mombasa water monitors water quality and attends to detected quality problems promptly.</p>

												<h2>Sewerage Services</h2>

													<h4>mombasa water sewerage department</h4>

													<p>Storm Water Drains and Foul Sewers in Mombasa were designed to carry flows separately to the ocean. Storm water is discharged directly to the ocean. Sewage is treated before discharging to the Marine Environment. The defunct Municipal Council through its Engineering Department was responsible for both storm water and sewerage facilities. In 2005 asset holding of Sewerage facilities was transferred to CWSB through a Lease Agreement (LA). Mombasa Water through A Service Provision Agreement (SPA) with CWSB took over the facilities for operation and maintenance only.</p>


													<h4>Raw sewage Island Pumping Stations</h4>

													<p>There are four pumping stations, located along the sea front on the eastern side of the Island which separately lift sewage from low areas through rising mains into the gravity system that leads to the Kizingo Treatment Plant.All the four Pumping Stations are similar in design with two single stage pumps, one duty and one standby.There has not been pumping in any of the four pumping stations for a very long time.</p>
													<h4>Kizingo Sewage Treatment Plant</h4>

													<p>The Kizingo Plant was designed to provide Primary treatment only.
													The screens and the sedimentation tanks were constructed underground, beneath the Mombasa Golf Course.
													The Screenings were automatically raked in the first chamber.
													At the bottom of twin tanks with three hoppers sludge that had accumulated was removed under hydrostatic pressure and discharged through a Sludge Draw-Off Pipe directly to the ocean on the ebb tide.
													The supernatant was discharged through an outfall 43 m away, 2m bsl.
													West Mainland Sewer Network</p>

													<p>The first sewers were built here in 1952 to serve the Government housing estates in Changamwe.
													In 1957 the piped sewerage was extended to serve the rail served Industrial area and later extensions were provided to serve the oil refinery and parts of Magongo.</p>

													<h4>Kipevu Sewage Treatment Plant</h4>

													<p>The Plant is located at Kipevu, adjacent to Kilindini Harbor with an outfall at berth No.14.
													It is an extended aeration facility, utilizing an oxidation ditch system, constructed under the Phase I of Mombasa Sewerage Project to replace the original Biological Filter Plant.
													The plant commissioned in the Year 2000, consists of pretreatment, aeration, clarification, sludge processing and sludge drying units.</p>
													<p>The plant was designed to serve a population equivalent of 200,000. The inflow is currently at less than 40% of the Design Average Dry Weather Flow of 17100 cm/day.</p>
