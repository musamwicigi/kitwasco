                                        The following areas are not adequately served or don’t receive water throughout the month. This normally happens during the dry spells when everybody turns to tap water and this is due to tapping from the rising main. The affected areas are:-<br/>
                                        1) Kihara line has many tappings and water rarely reaches their off take. Expected to improve when Masinga - Kitui Phase II is complete.<br/>
                                        2) Wii – the major supply is from Mbooni b/hole which broke down. <br/>Currently we use Kavisuni pipeline which doesn’t provide adequate supply and we have to close the main at Ngiluni junction.<br/>
                                        3) Ithiani/Itoleka/Ngengeka – this is determined by the level at Katheka tank, the other problem is the size of the pipeline serving those areas which is not adequate since it has been over tapped forcing us to stop installation of new connections along the area until the same has been up graded.<br/>
                                        4) Ikolania/Mbusyani – served by Mbooni borehole which is not operational.<br/>
                                        5) Mulango/Kisekini – this branch line has been over tapped for it was an individual line (connection) but today serving as a distribution for the area and so to serve the large no. of people calls for more time also upgrade Mulango pipeline.<br/>
                                        6) Mathulini/Kilonzo – depends on the levels at Kwa Ngindu tank which cannot be currently maintained and has also been over tapped. To improve when Masinga – Kitui Phase II is complete and upgrade the pipeline.<br/>
                                        7) Manyenyoni – has been over tapped, the pipeline needs to be upgraded from 25mm to 65mm and some areas be relocated to avoid interruptions. </p>

                                        Dear customers, pumping at Baricho Water Works resumed this evening at 7.05pm. It takes 6-8 hours for in-flow to commence at our Nguu Tatu Resevoirs. Consequently, normal supply will resume tomorrow God -willing, as per the distribution programme. We sincerely thank you for your support and patience and once again we apologize for the inconveniences caused. </p>
